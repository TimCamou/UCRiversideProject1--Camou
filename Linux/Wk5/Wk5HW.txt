### Step 1: Create, Extract, Compress, and Manage tar Backup Archives

1. Command to **extract** the `TarDocs.tar` archive to the current directory: tar -xf TarDocs.tar

2. Command to **create** the `Javaless_Doc.tar` archive from the `TarDocs/` directory, while excluding the `TarDocs/Documents/Java` directory: tar -cvvf Javaless_Docs.tar ?exclude=?TarDocs/Document/Java? TarDocs

3. Command to ensure `Java/` is not in the new `Javaless_Docs.tar` archive: tar -tvf Javaless_Docs.tar | grep Java

**Bonus** 
- Command to create an incremental archive called `logs_backup_tar.gz` with only changed files to `snapshot.file` for the `/var/log` directory:

#### Critical Analysis Question

- Why wouldn't you use the options `-x` and `-c` at the same time with `tar`? -x is extracting data from a tar file and -c is creating a new tar file so there is no data to extract.

### Step 2: Create, Manage, and Automate Cron Jobs

1. Cron job for backing up the `/var/log/auth.log` file:
0 6 * * 0 ./authlog_backup_script "authlog_backup_script" Contains: #!/bin/bash
tar cf logs_backups.tar /var/log/auth.log
---

### Step 3: Write Basic Bash Scripts

1. Brace expansion command to create the four subdirectories: Mkdir -p ~/backups/{freemem,diskuse,openlsit,freedisk}


2. Paste your `system.sh` script edits below:
#!/bin/bash

free -h > ~/backups/freemem/free_mem.txt
du -h > ~/backups/diskuse/disk_use.tx
lsof > ~/backups/openlist/open_list.txt
df -h > ~/backups/freedisk/free_disk.txt

3. Command to make the `system.sh` script executable:
chmod +x system.sh

### Step 4. Manage Log File Sizes
 
1. Run `sudo nano /etc/logrotate.conf` to edit the `logrotate` configuration file. 

    Configure a log rotation scheme that backs up authentication messages to the `/var/log/auth.log`.

    - Add your config file edits below:
